- Create an HTML table displaying default keys in Vim and my overrides
- Integrate tmux nicely
    - Learn vim bindings in tmux (e.g. for faster scrollback and copying text)
* Search project for TODO
- Add/groom mappings for all variations of file manipulation
    Create a new file (editing it immediately)
        From CWD
            ---> :edit 
        From current buffer's directory
            ---> :edit <C-r>=expand('%:h')<CR>/
    Copy a file (edit the copy immediately)
        To CWD
            ---> :saveas 
        To current buffer's directory
            ---> :saveas <C-r>=expand('%:h')<CR>/
    Move/Rename a file (continue editing it)
        To CWD
            ---> :Move 
        To current buffer's directory
            ---> :Rename 
    Delete a file
        --> :Delete

- Mappings Checklist
    - Should there be an operator and/or text object?
    - Does it have a visual mode equivalent?
    - Does it have an insert mode equivalent?
    - Does it have a command-line mode equivalent?
    - Is it using a noremap? If not, is it justified?

Over-Arching Goals to Keep in Mind
========================
- Use plugins sparingly, and only those that build upon existing vim philosophy.
- For manipulating text, create operators, text objects, and motions (instead of arbitrary leader mappings)
- Limit window chrome. Use commands that temporarily show the info only when you really want it.
- Autosave to file after any buffer modification. To the user, there should be no difference between a buffer and a file. They should be one-to-one. A buffer should always reflect the underlying file. Saving should not be necessary. Avoid the concept of buffers. Don't look at buffer lists or navigate between them the traditional way. DO NOT USE:
    :bn
    :bp
    :buffers
    :ls
    :Buffers
    :b *
  Use file system navigation and fuzzy file search.
- Automatically persist state between sessions(?)
- Unify file search and file creation(?)
- Helfp reduce congitive load

Begin utilizing these commands

zL             scroll screen half a screenwidth to left
zH             scroll screen half a screenwidth to right
!{text-object}{filter}      filter [count] lines through the external program {filter}
'^
